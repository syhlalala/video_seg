A Mix-domain Multimedia Algorithm in Video Segmentation

• Detect shot changes in a video and cut it into segments, each of which leads to an independent scene or story.

• Use multiple information(both auditory and visual information is considered), especially some high-level features, such as matched corner points.

• Do experiments on different types of videos: cartoons, sitcoms, teleplay and American dramas.

• Do necessary analysis on the effects of different features.
